      Exercise or workout is physical activity that enhances or maintains
      fitness and overall health. It is performed for various reasons, including
      weight loss or maintenance, to aid growth and improve strength, develop
      muscles and the cardiovascular system, prevent injuries, hone athletic
      skills, improve health, or simply for enjoyment. Many people choose to
      exercise outdoors where they can congregate in groups, socialize, and
      improve well-being as well as mental health.
